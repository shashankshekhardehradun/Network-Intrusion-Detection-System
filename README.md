# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
The immense popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud based applications have resulted in huge volumes of network traffic. Different versions of operating systems, multiple protocols and concurrent users contribute significantly towards the ever increasing computer security threats. Traditional methods involving shallow learning tech- niques like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc have been instrumental in advancing the study of network intrusion detection. 
However, as and when the network data expands in size and complexity, deep learning algorithms are needed to tackle the ongoing network security challenges. Deep learning methods are intrinsically capable of handling enormous data and their performance increases with increasing supply of the same. 
The proposed work details the configuration of a multi-class classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. UNSW NB-15, a modern dataset comprising of nine contemporary attack types is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results indicate that the proposed approach has exhibited a reasonably valid precision and recall percentage as compared to the preexisting methods.
